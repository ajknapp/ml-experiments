Implementations of some interesting machine learning and statistical techniques

This is a repository of machine learning techniques I found interesting enough to implement.
So far, this includes

- kernel methods
- nonparametric statistical methods
- compression learning methods

Each directory contains an implementation, either as a Python file, or an ipython notebook.
NB: the notebooks were created on [Quantopian](http://quantopian.com), so they use Quantopian's data.
